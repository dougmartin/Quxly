		@demoStart Quxly Demos
		
			Quixly lets you build human readable state machines that can then be "run" using a viewer like this one.  
			I built it originally because I was having difficulty discussing and documenting complex game animations with non-programmers.
			Since I built it I've found a lot of uses for it and I hope you do too.
			
			Quixly works by defining states and state transitions using a simple syntax inspired by Markdown. These demos actually use
			Markdown to format the description of each state but you are free to use whatever formatting you want.
			
			If you <a href="#" class="viewSource">view the source</a> of this page you'll see how these demos are built.  The Qux code is built
			right into the page!
			
			Click on one of the buttons below to start the demo.

		@ecommTransactionDemo Simple Ecommerce Transaction Demo
		
			This three state demo uses the following states (view source on this page and you'll see them).
		
			<pre>
			&#64;onItemPage Customer is viewing an item view page
				
				Page shows item image and description and the following buttons:
			
			    Add to Cart =&gt; @addToCart
			    Purchase (if cart is not empty) =&gt; @purchase
				
			&#64;addToCart "Add to Cart" button is pressed
			
				Item is added to the cart on the left hand side of the page with the item still
				visible on the page and a thumbnail of the item shown in the cart along with its title.
			
			    Purchase =&gt; @purchase
				
			&#64;purchase "Purchase" button is pressed
			
				The purchase page is loaded which shows with the contents of the cart along with a form
				to submit credit card information.
			</pre>

			ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will explore some of the 
			most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No computer should be without one!

		@zorkDemo Zork Demo
		
			This demo features the classic text adventure game, Zork 
			([text courtesy of Dennis G. Jerz](http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/canon/Zork.htm))
			
			The demo also shows one of the interesting features of Quxly: states names can be regular
			expressions.  When each state is initially read its name is compared to all the existing 
			states already defined.  If there is a match then the definition and next states of the 
			current state are added to the matched state(s).

			This demo shows another feature of Quxly - mixins.  You define a mixin using a starting dot and then
			use that mixin within other states or mixins with the &#43;= operator.  In the example below we
			have headers built from other headers which saves you from repeating yourself.  A wildcard state
			is also used to add the footer to all the homepage states.
