			Quixly lets you build human readable state machines that can then be "run" using a viewer like this one.  
			I built it originally because I was having difficulty discussing and documenting complex game animations with non-programmers.
			Since I built it I've found a lot of uses for it and I hope you do too.
			
			Quixly works by defining states and state transitions using a simple syntax inspired by Markdown. These demos actually use
			Markdown to format the description of each state but you are free to use whatever formatting you want.
			
			If you <a href="#" class="viewSource">view the source</a> of this page you'll see how these demos are built.  The Qux code is built
			right into the page!
			
			Click on one of the buttons below to start the demo.

			is also used to add the footer to all the homepage states.

			Quxly is a compiler and viewer for a human readable state definition language created
			to try to solve the following problems:
			
			1. How do you define how systems change over time in a way everyone can understand?
			2. How do you track changes to the system definition?
			3. What is the most flexible way to visualize state changes?
			
			Quxly is free and open source using a dual MIT and GPL license.  You are free to
			pick which one suits you best, just keep the copyright info intact.
			
			- [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)
			- [GPL License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
			
			Now, onto the stuff you probably actually care about...
			
			+= .basicSyntax
			+= .advancedSyntax
			+= .internals
			
		@basicSyntax Basic Syntax
			
			### Comments
			
			Comments start with two slashes as the first non-space character on the line:
			
			<pre>
			&#47;&#47; This is the login form ...
			</pre>
			
			### States
			
			State names start with the @ sign and can use any non-space character. The text after the
			state name (on the same line) is assigned as the title for the state:  

			<pre>
			&#47;&#47; This is the login form ...
			&#64;loginFormIsShown The login form is shown
			</pre>
			
			Text between state names is not parsed except for the following two operators: =&gt; and &#43;=
			
			### State Changes
			
			The =&gt; operator defines a state change with the left hand side being the optional label 
			(it will default to "Next" if one is not given) and the right hand side being a state name with
			the @ sign:
			
			<pre>
			&#47;&#47; This is the login form ...
			&#64;loginFormIsShown The login form is shown
				Login =&gt; @loginFormProcessed
			</pre>
			
			The &#43;= operator is for including a mixin and is covered in the advanced syntax section.
			
			### State Descriptions
			
			Everything else is a free form description of the state with no formatting rules.  This
			documentation uses a view that processes the text as Markdown but you can pick the formatting
			you like.
			
			<pre>
			&#47;&#47; This is the login form ...
			&#64;loginFormIsShown The login form is shown
			
				- Username field
				- Password field
				
				Login =&gt; @loginFormProcessed
			</pre>			
			
			+= .documentationHome
			+= .advancedSyntax
			+= .internals
			
		@advancedSyntax Advanced Syntax

			### Wildcard states
			
			In the basic syntax it was explained that state named can use any non-space character.  
			However, when a new state is defined it is compared against previous states using the name as a 
			regular expression.  Any matching states will have the current states definition and next state rules
			applied to them.  This lets you apply a single definition against multiple states, saving you time:
			
			<pre>
			&#64;loginFormIsShown The login form is shown
				&#46;.. login stuff here
				
			&#64;signupFormIsShown The signup form is shown
				&#46;.. signup stuff here
				
			&#64;.*Form.*
				&#46;.. anything here will be added to the two matching "Form" states above but not the states after it.
				
			&#64;formPasswordFormIsShown The forgot password form is show
				&#46;.. this is not touched
			</pre>
			
			### Mixins
			
			The basic syntax also mentioned mixins.  Mixins are defined using a leading period and can then be
			"mixed in" to subsequent states using the &#43;= operator.  Mixins work the same as wildcard states
			but they are added within the description of the state.  Like wildcard states you can mixin
			wildcard mixin definitions:
			
			<pre>
			&#46;footerLinks
				- About us
				- Copyright
				- Terms of Service
				
			&#46;userLinks
				- Login
				- Logout
				- Register
				
			&#64;homepage The Homepage
				&#43;= &#46;footerLinks
				&#43;= &#46;userLinks
				&#47;&#47; or you could do this: &#43;= &#46;.*Links
			</pre>
			
			You can also mixin other states.  I'm not sure why you would want to but it was easy to implement :)
			
			### Meta Definitions
			
			Meta definitions start with two percent signs (%%).  Currently there is only one meta definition, 
			tabSpacing, which controls how tabs are expanded and defaults to 4 spaces.  This changes it to 8:
			
			&#37;&#37; tabSpacing: 8
			
			That's it!

			+= .basicSyntax
			+= .internals
			
		@internals Internals
		
			Qux definitions are compiled and placed in a QUXFile() module which can be seen in the quxly.js
			file.  The QUXViewer() module reads QUXFile() objects, builds the elements in the browser and
			handles the state changes.  Getting the text into the QUXFile() is up to you but it is easy
			to implement loading text from inside specially marked script tags in your html or via an AJAX
			call.
			
			Building your own viewer that works on top of the QUXViewer() is pretty simple.  You are looking
			at one right now.  View the source to see how it works.
