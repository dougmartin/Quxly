		@demoStart Quxly Demo
		
			This demo shows how Quxly works.  Use the view source option on your browser to see how this is built.
			
			Quixly lets you build human readable state machines that can then be "run" using a viewer like this one.  
			I built it originally because I was having difficulty discussing and documenting complex game animations with non-programmers.
			Since I built it I've found a lot of uses for it and I hope you do too.
			
			Quixly works by defining states and state tranistions using a simple syntax inspired by Markdown. This demo actually uses
			Markdown to format the description of each state but you are free to use whatever formatting you want.
			
			Here is a simple three state machine to document how a typical e-commerce transaction is done.  You can use your brower's
			back and forward buttons to move around once you are in the demo.
			
			Simple Ecommerce Transaction => @ecommTransaction
			
		@ecommTransaction Simple Ecommerce Transaction Demo
		
			This three state demo uses the following states (view source on this page and you'll see them).
		
			<pre>
			&#64;onItemPage Customer is viewing an item view page
				
				Page shows item image and description and the following buttons:
			
			    Add to Cart =&gt; @addToCart
			    Purchase (if cart is not empty) =&gt; @purchase
				
			&#64;addToCart "Add to Cart" button is pressed
			
				Item is added to the cart on the left hand side of the page with the item still
				visible on the page and a thumbnail of the item shown in the cart along with its title.
			
			    Purchase =&gt; @purchase
				
			&#64;purchase "Purchase" button is pressed
			
				The purchase page is loaded which shows with the contents of the cart along with a form
				to submit credit card information.
			</pre>
